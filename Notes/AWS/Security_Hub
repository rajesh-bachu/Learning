AWS Security Hub:

Introduction: 
    What is Security Hub?
        - Centralized Security Alerts
            Centralize Security alerts from GuardDuty, Macie, and Inspector, as well as 3rd party tools

        - Automatically Monitor CIS Benchmarks
            Security Hub will automatically begin to monitor CIS Benchmarks
        
        - Send Notifications for Alerts
            If an alerty is created, ensure the correct people receive a notification.

Security Baselines:        
    What is a security Baseline?
        - Formalized List of Security Standards
            Define the standards for your organization, including which services to use and how they should be configured.
        - Create Processes to Configure Standards
            Use processes to help set up and enforce security standards.
        - Repeat Processes for New Accounts
            Ensure that new AWS accounts all meet the same basic standards.

Security Baseline Tips
    - Start from an Established Framework
        Use a popular 3rd party framework, like CIS, as a foundation for your baseline.
    - Use Infrastructure as a Code When possible
        Automate standing up security pieces with a service like CloudFormation to provide consistent results.
    - Update Your Baseline Regularly
        As new services become available, make sure to keep your standards up to date.

CIS Benchmarks:
    - Provides security recommendations for different cloud providers, servers and applications.
    - Provides a set of AWS Security Standards, specific to the services AWS provides.
    - Benchmark include steps to perform audits, as well as remediate issues.

    4 main sections for AWS CIS Benchmarks
    
    1. IAM - Follow best practices with IAM users, groups and policies
    2. Logging - Ensure Events and Actions in your accounts being recorded.
    3. Monitoring - Receive alerts when important security changes are made.
    4. Networking - Lockdown common security issues, like open ports.


	IAM: 
        - Ensure account password policy requires atleast 14 characters, including upper case and lower case characters.
        - Ensure MFA is enabled, specially for root account.
        - Ensure credentials are rotated atleast every 90 days.
    Logging:
        - Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.
        - Ensure VPC Flow Logs are enabled on all VPCs.
        - Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions.
    Monitoring:
        - Ensure alarms exist for unauthorized API calls.
        - Ensure alarms exist for changes to VPCs and SGs.
        - Ensure alarms exist for S3 bucket policy changes.
    Networking:
        - Ensure no security group allows ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 (SSH).
        - Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389 (RDP).
