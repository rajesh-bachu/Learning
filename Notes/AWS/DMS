Essential Migration Terminology:
    - Database Engine
        - DBMS
        - MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
    - Source    
        - Database that is the origin of data being migrated/replicated from
    - Target
        - Destination database that data is being migrated/replicated to.

Common Use cases:
    - Migration:
        - On-premises to AWS
        - Cloud-to-cloud Migration
        - Change database engine
    - Replicaiton
        - Database to data warehouse
        - Multi-cloud replication
        - Data streams and derived storage
    Consolidation
        - Reducing quantity of instances
        - Cost Optimization.

    Database Migration Classifications:
        - Homogeneous
            - Both Source and target use the same database engine
        - Heterogeneous
            - When source and target use a different database engine.

Replication Instances:
    - What is replication instance:
        - Specialized compute resource
        - Foundation of DMS
    - What does Replication Instance do?
        - Initial Load
        - Ongoing replication of changes
        - Publishes logs and monitoring stats.
    - Configurability
        - Choose instance size and type
    - Understanding Replication Workload
        - Incoming changes
        - Sorter
        - Outgoing changes
    - Instance Types
        - R: For High transactions per second
        - T: For light workloads and testing
        - C: Compute intensive, good for heterogeneous migrations.
