    OSI 7-Layer Model (Networking Stack)
        It is conceptual and

            L1 Physical

        bottom 3 are Media Layer - how data is moved from A to B
        above 4 are Host Layers - how data is chopped

        L1 - Physical.
            - Network Cards
            - LAN Game in same network: connect to same wifi or connect laptops using a network cable
            - something like coppor network cable - transit electric signals
            - copper(electrical), Fibre(light) or WIFI(RF)
            - L1 (Physical) specifications define the transmission and reception of RAW BIT STREAMS between a device and a SHARED physical medium. It defines things like voltage levels, timing, rates, distances, modulation and connectors.
            - Physical shared medium
            - Standards for transmitting onto the medium
            - Standards for receiving from the medium
            - No access control
            - No uniquely identified devices
            - No device=>device communications

        Fibre Optic Cables
            - A thin glass / plastic core surrounded by protection
            - ~ the diameter of a human hair
            - Transmit light over the cable
            - Can cover larger distances
            - Higher speeds ~Tbit/s speeds in recent tests
            - Resistant to EMI and less prone to water ingress
            - More consistent (normally) vs copper cable
            - Fibre diameter is expressed as X/Y e.g. 9/125, X is the diameter of the core, Y is the diameter if the cladding (both in microns)
            - Core: The core is the physical medium which carries light between transmitter and receiver.
            - Cladding: The cladding is a boundary surrounding the core to contain the light, allowing data to move through the lenght of the core.
            - Buffer: The buffer is a combination of internal coating & strengthening fibres designed to absorb shock and provide additional strength for the core(s). This is surrounded by a cable jacked.
            - Single Mode: Yellow Jacket. One (single) mode (ray) of light only. 
                            Laser Optics, less distortion, 
                            Longest distances - highest "bandwidth"
                            Cheaper than multimode, transmission is expensive
            - Multimode: Orange/Aqua Jacket
                            Multiple modes (rays) of light 
                            LED Optics, more distortion with distance
                            Short distance - high bandwidth, longer = lower
            - Fibre Optic Transceivers
                - SFP Transceiver Module (SFP or MINI GBIC)
                - ..single form-factor pluggable
                - Generates and sends, or receives light TO/FROM fibre
                - Multi-mode or Single-Mode
                - Optimised for a cable type
                - 1000BASE-LX, 10GBASE-LR, 100GBASE-LR4
        
        Layer 2 - Data link
            - Frame
                - PREAMBLE 56 Bits SFD - 8 Bits
                - MAC HEADER
                    - Destination MAC address
                    - Source MAC address
                    - ET 16 Bits
                - PAYLOAD 46-1500 BYTES
                    The Payload is the data the frame carries from source to destination. It's generally provided by Layer 3 .. and the 'EtherType (ET)' attribute defines which L3 Protocol is used (e.g IP)
                - FCS 32 Bits
                
            - Runs over Layer 1
            - Devices at L2 have a unique hardware (MAC) address e.g 3e:22:... .48 bits, in hex, 24 bits for manufacturer. 
            - Frames can be addressed to a destination or broadcast (AA F's)
            - Steps of any data transfer in L2
                - A uses Layer 2 (Ethernet) - intends to send data to 3e:22...:76. 
                    Layer 2 creates a Frame F1
                - Checks Carrier
                - If NO carrier, layer 1 takes the frame data, converts to physical standard and transmits
                - L1 (Right) receives, and passes frame to layer 2
                - When B needs to send to A .. its Layer 2 builds a frame
                - Carrier detected? Wait another device is transmitting.
                - Frame Sent to Layer 1 for transmission.
                - If collisions are detected (both transmitting at once) both backoff for a time + random. Increases if another close collision.
            - DAta is encapsulated.
            - When Layer 2 is used, all operations happened in L1 is unvisible and abstracted.
            - Layer 2 using a HUB
                - HUBS are Layer 2 devices, they don't understand frames
                - HUBS have a Single collision. domain collisions are also repeated and impact all devices.
                - If the top laptop sends a frame with a destination of the bottom laptop - the HUB repeats ... all laptops receive the frame.
            - Layer 2 using a Switch
                - Switches understand frames and MAC Addresses. They maintain a MAC address table which starts off empty. 
                    As the Switch receives frames on its ports, it learns which devices are connected and populates the Mac address table.
                - Switches STORE and FORWARD.. they dont repeat blindly like hubs. It means that only valid frames are forwarded. 
                    collisions are isolated on the port they occured. Every X port switch has X collision domains. 
                    It allows switches to scale and be connected together.
            - Layer 2 summary:
                - Identifiable devices
                - Media access control (sharing)
                - Collision Detection
                - Unicast 1:1
                - Broadcast 1:ALL
                - Switches - Like Hubs with Super powers (Layer 2)
        
        Decimal to Binary:
            - Rules
                - 1. Compare decimal number to Binary position value, if SMALLER WRITE 0 => move on to next table position, gotoÂ£1
                - 2. If IT IS EQUAL OR LARGER - Minus the binary position value from your decimal number, add 1 in the binary value column
                - 3. Move on to next position, goto #1 (with new deicmal value)
        Binary => Decimal:
            - Rules 
                - 
        L3 Network:
            - Internet Protocol is a Layer 3 Protocol which adds cross-network IP addressing and routing to move data between LAN without direct P2P links.
            - IP Packets are moved step by step from source to destination via intermediate networks. Encapsulated in different frames along the way.
            - Routers (L3) devices, remove frame encapsulation and add new frame encapsulation at every hop.
            - It's the Subnet Mask which allows a HOST to determine if an IP address it needs to communicate with is local or remote- which influences if it needs to use a gateway or can communicate locally.
            - A Subnet Mask is configured on a host device in addition to an IP address. e.g. 255.255.0.0 & this is the same as a /16 prefix.
            - Route Tables & Routes
                - Router compares packet destination IP & route table for matching destinations. The more specific prefixes are preferred (0 lowest, 32 highest). Packet is forwarded on to the Next Hop/Target.
                - Packets are routed, hop by hop across the internet. From source to destination.
            - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
            - summary
                - IP Addresses (IPv4/v6) - cross networking addressing
                - ARP - Find the MAC address, for this IP
                - Route - where to forward this packet.
                - Route Tables - Multiple routes
                - Router - moves packets from SRC to DST - Encapsulating in L2 on the way
                - Device <=> Device Communications over the internet.
                - No method for channels of communications .. SRC IP <=> DST IP Only
                - Can be delivered out of order.
    DNS:
        - DNS is a discovery service
        - Translates machine into human and vice-versa
        - www.amazon.com => 104.98.34.131
        - It's huge and has to be distributed
        - 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses
        - ..... IPv6 addresses
        Key Terms:
            - DNS Client - your laptop, phone, tablet, PC
            - Resolver - software on your device, or a server which queries DNS on your behalf
            - Zone - A part of the DNS database (e.g. amazon.com)
            - Zonefile - physical database for a zone
            - Nameserver - where zonefiles are hosted.
            - Root Hints - config points at the root servers IPs and addresses
            - Root Server - hosts the DNS root zone
            - Root Zone - points at TLD authoritative servers
            - gTLD - Generic top level domain (.com .org)
            - ccTLD - country-code top level domain (.uk .eu etc)
