    Networking Starter Pack:
        - Local Networking - Ethernet
        - Routing
        - Segmenting, Ports & Sessions
        - Applications
        - OSI 7 Layer Model
    
    OSI 7-Layer Model (Networking Stack)
        It is conceptual and 
            L7 Application
            L6 Presentation
            L5 Session
            L4 Transport
            L3 Network
            L2 Data Link
            L1 Physical

        bottom 3 are Media Layer - how data is moved from A to B
        above 4 are Host Layers - how data is chopped

        L1 - Physical.
            - Network Cards
            - LAN Game in same network: connect to same wifi or connect laptops using a network cable
            - something like coppor network cable - transit electric signals
            - copper(electrical), Fibre(light) or WIFI(RF)
            - L1 (Physical) specifications define the transmission and reception of RAW BIT STREAMS between a device and a SHARED physical medium. It defines things like voltage levels, timing, rates, distances, modulation and connectors.
            - Physical shared medium
            - Standards for transmitting onto the medium
            - Standards for receiving from the medium
            - No access control
            - No uniquely identified devices
            - No device=>device communications

        Fibre Optic Cables
            - A thin glass / plastic core surrounded by protection
            - ~ the diameter of a human hair
            - Transmit light over the cable
            - Can cover larger distances
            - Higher speeds ~Tbit/s speeds in recent tests
            - Resistant to EMI and less prone to water ingress
            - More consistent (normally) vs copper cable
            - Fibre diameter is expressed as X/Y e.g. 9/125, X is the diameter of the core, Y is the diameter if the cladding (both in microns)
            - Core: The core is the physical medium which carries light between transmitter and receiver.
            - Cladding: The cladding is a boundary surrounding the core to contain the light, allowing data to move through the lenght of the core.
            - Buffer: The buffer is a combination of internal coating & strengthening fibres designed to absorb shock and provide additional strength for the core(s). This is surrounded by a cable jacked.
            - Single Mode: Yellow Jacket. One (single) mode (ray) of light only. 
                            Laser Optics, less distortion, 
                            Longest distances - highest "bandwidth"
                            Cheaper than multimode, transmission is expensive
            - Multimode: Orange/Aqua Jacket
                            Multiple modes (rays) of light 
                            LED Optics, more distortion with distance
                            Short distance - high bandwidth, longer = lower
            - Fibre Optic Transceivers
                - SFP Transceiver Module (SFP or MINI GBIC)
                - ..single form-factor pluggable
                - Generates and sends, or receives light TO/FROM fibre
                - Multi-mode or Single-Mode
                - Optimised for a cable type
                - 1000BASE-LX, 10GBASE-LR, 100GBASE-LR4
        
        Layer 2 - Data link
            - Frame
                - PREAMBLE 56 Bits SFD - 8 Bits
                - MAC HEADER
                    - Destination MAC address
                    - Source MAC address
                    - ET 16 Bits
                - PAYLOAD 46-1500 BYTES
                    The Payload is the data the frame carries from source to destination. It's generally provided by Layer 3 .. and the 'EtherType (ET)' attribute defines which L3 Protocol is used (e.g IP)
                - FCS 32 Bits
                
            - Runs over Layer 1
            - Devices at L2 have a unique hardware (MAC) address e.g 3e:22:... .48 bits, in hex, 24 bits for manufacturer. 
            - Frames can be addressed to a destination or broadcast (AA F's)
